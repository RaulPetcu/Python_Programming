  A **password manager** which sotres credentials for websites in a structured text file in which the passwords are encrypted. Only the user who knows the **master_password** can update the file via specific terminal commands of this type : "pwmanager.py <master_password> -<operation> <website> <username> <password>". The operations available are add/remove/update/get. The file has encrypted passwords, but based on the master_password, user can get the decrypted passwords in the terminal.
